# Baby Sleep Tracker (SovetidPlus)

This repository contains an iOS application that helps caregivers keep track of a baby's sleep sessions. The design embraces a "liquid glass" aesthetic inspired by Control Center while focusing on quick capture of naps, manual corrections, and a clear historical overview.

## Features

- **One-tap sleep tracking** – start or stop the active sleep session from the home screen's prominent control.
- **Manual corrections** – log historical naps with validation to prevent invalid durations.
- **Daily insights** – review the last few sessions, totals for the current day, and whether a session is active.
- **Calendar history** – browse previous days, view total hours slept per day, and inspect the individual sessions recorded.
- **Offline-first data** – sleep sessions are persisted locally using Core Data, ensuring the app works without connectivity.

## Architecture

- `PersistenceController` bootstraps an in-memory or on-disk Core Data stack with the `SleepSession` entity.
- `SleepStore` is the `ObservableObject` consumed by SwiftUI views. It fetches sessions, exposes convenience helpers, and keeps the UI updated.
- `ContentView` provides the primary tracking experience, including the animated start/stop button, status, and recent history.
- `ManualEntryView` surfaces a modal form for logging earlier naps, delegating persistence to `SleepStore`.
- `SleepCalendarView` renders a month grid and per-day detail, leveraging helpers in `CalendarExtensions`.
- Shared UI building blocks like `GlassBackground` and `ScaleButtonStyle` live in `GlassViews`.

## Running the App

1. Open `SovetidPlus.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer.
2. Select the "SovetidPlus" scheme and your desired iPhone simulator.
3. Build and run (`⌘R`).

Previews for each SwiftUI view can also be explored directly within Xcode. Tests are currently placeholders generated by the SwiftUI app template.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. When adding features, ensure new Core Data changes are reflected in the programmatic model inside `Persistence.swift` and consider augmenting the `README` to keep the documentation current.
